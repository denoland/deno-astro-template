# üöÄ Astro 2.x + ü¶ï Deno Template

This sample project contains a recommended starting point for your Deno project
using Astro 2. For an Astro 3 compatible template, check
[here](https://github.com/denoland/deno-astro-template) instead.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using this template

This template requires the Deno runtime to be installed on your computer. If you
haven't already, please
[install Deno first](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).
Next, initialize a new Astro project using this template with your favorite
[npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/install), as
described in the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template denoland/deno-astro-template
```

GitHub will also let you
[use this repository as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) -
use the green "Use this template" button near the top of the page to create your
own copy of this application.

#### Why use Astro with Deno?

This template is preconfigured to use Deno rather than Node.js as the JavaScript
runtime for this
[server-side rendering Astro application](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/).
This provides a few benefits:

- The ability to use built-in `Deno` namespace functions, notably the new
  built-in [Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv) database.
- The ability to run in production on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), a
  high performance, globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript
  applications.
- [Compatibility with the majority of packages on npm](https://deno.land/manual@v1.17.2/npm_nodejs/compatibility_mode),
  both at the runtime level and via the Astro build process (thanks to Vite and
  esbuild).

#### Local development

To use this template for local development, you will use npm scripts in
`package.json` in the same way as described in the Astro documentation. However,
these scripts are configured execute the same commands using the Deno runtime
instead of Node.js.

- Start the local development server with `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- Build a production-ready SSR site with `npm run build`
- After building, you can preview your SSR site locally with `npm run preview`

The template project lightly modifies the base Astro project with some basic
CRUD operations to create additional resource links.

## üîå Managing dependencies, integrations, and plugins

We recommend **using npm to manage dependencies for this project**. Astro was
designed to be used with npm, and enhanced with plugins and other tools also
hosted on npm. Deno's Node/npm compatibility layer should be able to handle this
just fine. If you run into any compatibility issues,
[please let us know](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues).

## üóùÔ∏è Using Deno KV

By default, the template project stores data in memory in a
[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).
If you'd like to instead use [Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv) to store your data,
change the `import` statements in these files:

- `src/pages/index.astro`
- `src/pages/api/resources.json.ts`

to use `resources_kv.ts` instead of `resources.ts`. This will work for everyone
locally on recent versions of Deno, but will only work on Deno Deploy if you
have applied for and received access to the beta for KV.

## ü¶ï üöÄ Running on Deno Deploy

When you're ready to put this application on the Internet, you can run it on
[Deno Deploy](https://www.deno.com/deploy). You have two options for doing so.

#### Deploy via GitHub Actions

- Create a new project on the
  [Deno Deploy Dashboard](https://dash.deno.com/projects)
- Choose to "Deploy an existing GitHub repository"
- Choose your GitHub user and the repository where you are storing this
  application
- You will be prompted to add a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file that will
  automatically build and deploy your application on every push to the `main`
  branch.

The `yml` file's final build step should look like this:

```yml
- name: Upload to Deno Deploy
  uses: denoland/deployctl@v1
  with:
    # Replace with your Deno Deploy project name
    project: deno-astro-template
    entrypoint: server/entry.mjs
    root: dist
```

- The `project` property should be your new Deno Deploy project's name
- The `entrypoint` for our Astro SSR application is `server/entry.mjs`
- The `root` for our app is the `dist` folder

Once this file is committed to your repo, every push to `main` will result in a
new version of your application being pushed to production.

#### Deploy from your desktop using `deployctl`

- Install the command line tools for `deployctl` and configure an API token
  environment variable
  [as described here](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/deployctl).
- Create a new blank project at [dash.deno.com](https://dash.deno.com/projects)
  and note the generated project name
- Build the Astro site locally with `npm run build`
- Deploy the newly generated site in the `dist` folder with this command:

```
deployctl deploy --project=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME --no-static --include=./dist ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

## ü§î Caveats and limitations

The Astro build process still runs your Deno code through Vite and esbuild to
generate your SSR site. This means that not all JavaScript and TypeScript
language features will work exactly the same way - most notably,
[HTTPS module imports](https://deno.land/manual@v1.15.2/examples/import_export#remote-import).

If you encounter situations where you require a Deno module that is only
available via HTTPS import, or discover that there's a Deno runtime language
feature that you can't live without, I would recommend writing Deno-specific
code in a separate folder (say `src-deno`) and then using
[dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) to transpile that code into the main
`src` folder, where you can import it in your Astro code. In reality, this
should not be necessary all that often.

This template also uses a patched version of Astro's Deno SSR adapter in
`astro.config.js` - this will eventually be removed once
[this pull request is merged](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/7687) and
`@astrojs/deno` is suitable for use!
